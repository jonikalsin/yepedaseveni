With that in mind, he voiced concern about Carli’s whereabouts. He stopped short of saying whether authorities believe she was kidnapped.&nbsp; But he noted that it had been days since her last known whereabouts can can be ascertained, and neither her credit card nor her phone have registered any activity.</p><p>“I’m not really going to comment on what I believe,” he said. “It doesn’t really matter what I believe. I mean, the evidence is what we go on. And right now, we don’t have enough evidence to determine if she’s alive or if she’s deceased.”</p><p>What deputies are saying, however, is that Carli was at the restaurant for the custody exchange of her three-year-old daughter to <strong>Marcus Spanevelo</strong>, the little girl’s father.</p><p>Carli’s loved ones told local reporters that her father received texts from Carli’s phone Sunday night that did not sound like her.</p><p>“Especially the claims of car and phone troubles at the same time,” sister Raeann told <a href=#>WKRG</a>. “She would have walked to the nearest gas station if she had to before getting Marcus for any type of help in a situation like that.”</p><p>Johnson declined to say what was in the purse. Carli’s family reportedly said her phone was missing.</p><p>“I’m sorry, car was acting up,” a text allegedly stated. “Marcus is working on it. I will stay at his place tonight. He is paying me money to do some stuff around his house.”</p><p>Deputies said they found Spanevelo and the three-year-old daughter in Birmingham, Alabama. Spanevelo reportedly works in that state.</p><p>Birmingham is four hours north of Navarre Beach, where Carli was last seen.</p><p>Child protective services spoke with the girl, said Sheriff Johnson, who declined to comment on what these officials talked about with the girl. Deputes did not speak with her, he said. Johnson also declined to reveal Spanevelo’s version of events.</p><p>“We are intent on speaking with him again,” he said. As part of their work, investigators are searching outside Santa Rosa County, he said.</p><p>Law&Crime could not reach Spanevelo for comment.</p><p>According to Carli’s brother <strong>Anthony</strong>, Cassie had said over last two years that Spanevelo had been threatening her.</p><p>“She is always in contact with her family and friends,” Raeann added. “Even during the exchange, she would have texted. Our red flag was Marcus.”</p><p>Deputies describe Carli as standing 5’5″, weighing 150 pounds, and as having blonde hair and blue eyes.</p><p>Anyone with information is asked to contact local law enforcement or the Santa Rosa County Crime Stoppers Program at (850) 437-STOP. There is a reward for up to $3,000 for closure of the case.</p><p>“With Crime Stoppers, you can remain 100% anonymous,” the authorities said.</p><p>You can also reach the Santa Rosa County Sheriff’s Office at (850) 983-1190.</p><p>[Image via Santa Rosa County Sheriff’s Office]</p><p>Have a tip we should know? <a href=#><span class=__cf_email__ data-cfemail=b2c6dbc2c1f2ded3c5d3dcd6d1c0dbdfd79cd1dddf>[email&nbsp;protected]</span></a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue8KroKadX5iutL%2FInmScmaKhtm65yKyqoqaXYrOzu8xmqpqmpJZ6s7vSmmScp6Wjwbp5xaWmq6GUlnw%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
