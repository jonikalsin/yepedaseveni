The first stanza describes the feeling of being in a cold war-like situation with a partner, where communication or affection are lacking. The metaphor of a brick wall is used to depict the brittleness or staleness of this relationship. However, the singer remains hopeful that things can be rectified, that they can have a slow burn of love, where passion and connection gradually build up over time. The singer confesses to wanting the partner despite the difficulties and believes that they can work things out.</p><br><p>The chorus repeats the imagery of holding onto the partner and the hope of being victorious in the relationship. The singer asks for the touch of the partner's hand, the sound of their voice, and their heart, as a promise of victory in the face of their relationship challenges. In this way, the lyrics speak to what it takes to make a relationship work, staying true to each other, communicating well, and being there for one another.</p><br><p>Overall, "Victorious" is a song of hope amidst relationship struggles. It is a call to hold on tight to what one loves, to keep working on building a stronger bond, and to never give up on love.<br></p><br><a id=meaning-linebyline class=aMean href=#><span>Line by Line Meaning</span></a><a id=editlines title="Suggest Edits to Line by Line Meaning" href=#></a><br><p><u>Hungry as a fire, waiting for the flicker</u><br>I am impatiently waiting for a sign or indication, like a flicker, to ignite my passion that is burning inside of me.</p><br><p><u>Waiting for the black hook, slow burn of love</u><br>I am waiting for love that takes time and effort, like a slow burn.
