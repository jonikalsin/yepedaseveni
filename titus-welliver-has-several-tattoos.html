Instead, it’s his tattoos, which number in the hundreds.</strong></p><h2>Tattoos on Titus Welliver</h2><figure id=attachment_1439218 aria-describedby=caption-attachment-1439218 style=width:650px class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img decoding=async src alt="Titus Welliver " width=650 height=400 data-sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Titus Welliver tattoos(Source; Pinterest)</strong></figure><p>So, in response to the inquiry, “Does Titus Welliver have a tattoo?” He does, and he has a lot of them.</p><p>His interest in inks is not a new one for him. On the contrary, he has always enjoyed it since he was a child, “much too young,” he told himself.</p><p>His first tattoo was a martial arts dojo consisting of two koi around a rock. It indicates “power and mobility,” according to Welliver.</p><p>Titus sat down for an interview with the Inked to discuss how tattoos have influenced his life and profession.</p><p>In addition to the many types of tattoos he has, he revealed that he had around <strong>30 tattoos (as of 2018)</strong> and stated,</p><p>“Some are the names and birth dates of my children, while others are related to my Irish and Native American heritage.”</p><p>Well, one thing is certain: Welliver appreciates the meaningful meaning behind his inks. Furthermore, Welliver has three children who appear to enjoy his designs.</p><p>Titus then discussed how the stigma associated with tattoos has evolved, stating that it was previously “negatively stigmatized,” but that it has now “dramatically transformed,</p><p>” He also reflected on how they were once outlawed in several states.</p><p>The topic then went to his Hollowood career and whether his inks had ever had an impact on it. His remark was profound and one-of-a-kind.</p><p>“I know a lot of actors with tattoos. “I don’t think Hollywood necessarily needs more actors wearing them,” he added, “but body art is now more widespread, and we can see more characters in television and cinema who aren’t just evil guys or special forces troops.” Tattoos are still used in Hollywood to show badassery.”</p><p>Which is correct. The stigma surrounding tattoos has shifted dramatically over the years, and it is now widely accepted everywhere from the fashion world to the acting industry.</p><p>Welliver, who is also known for portraying a badass role in ‘Bosch,’ has never covered up his inks, and the show’s creators decided to retain his inks intact, which only made his character shine brighter on screen.</p><p>Apart from saying that his designs reflect his love for his children and ancestry, the actor has never revealed much about his designs.</p><p>However, there may be a comprehensive glimpse into one of his inks that duplicates another important facet of his life.</p><p>Also Read: <a class=waffle-rich-text-link href=#>Atz Lee Kilcher, A Star Of “Alaska: The Last Frontier,” Got Married</a></p><h2>Titus Welliver’s Honoring of His Favorite</h2><p>Titus has a tattoo commemorating one of his favorite musical groups. He is recognized for his love of jazz, but it appears that he enjoys other types of music as well.</p><p>One of his tattoos pays homage to his favorite band, the Deftones. He was inspired by the band’s White Pony album.</p><p>When asked about his tattoos and admiration for the band, he stated. “In terms of musical preferences, I’m virtually psychotic.</p><p>But for the Deftones, tattooing the white pony picture on my bicep is symbolic of my connection and love for the band.”</p><p>Although we were unable to obtain all of the designs of his numerous inks, one thing is certain: Titus enjoys inks and enjoys adding them to his collection as he creates new memories along the road.</p><p>So we are confident that he will add more over the years, and we will keep you updated on any changes to his tattoos.</p><p>Also Read: <a class=waffle-rich-text-link href=#>Wife, Girlfriend, And Family Of Adam G.
