That's why he has found a special connection to the SWAGGA rhythm, a new one that "fat activists" have created so that many more people feel freer to join.</p><p><h3 class=Kg><strong class=Dg>FACING CONSEQUENCES</strong></h3></p><p class=Fg>Bullying and body shaming are serious things and <a class="Xd a" href=#>kids who harass other peers</a> should be told that their actions have consequences. Like this father had to do when he learned that his eldest daughter, Callie, was involved in harassing an overweight girl in her school.</p><p class=Fg>One day he received a call from a crying woman who claimed that her daughter was harassed by Callie and her friends. They took photos of the girl in ‘funny’ poses, such as bending over when she was picking something up.</p><p class=Fg>The girl was over-weight and the photographs had to do with fat shaming. The girl felt humiliated and tried to slit her wrists and was taken to the hospital. The father was upset.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlazAb63MqKSapZFjsLC5jmpocHFoanqlrc2cnKtlkqq5rbXEnWSfmaRivbO71Z6qZq%2BipLuoecOapZyhnpx7qcDMpQ%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
