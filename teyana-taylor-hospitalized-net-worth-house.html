She had all the fans worried, and the singer has shared via her Instagram by posting a photo of herself lying in bed showing a peace sign. She began to explain,<strong> “Y’all know Petunia don’t miss no shows & most importantly, know I’ve been leaving it all on the stage for a month straight 1000%. So I am really saddened to have not been able to do the same for you last night.”</strong></span></p><p><span>She added,<strong> “My team and I tried everything down to the very last second to get me out on that stage, but my body simply just gave out, which actually started a few days ago.”</strong></span></p><p><span>She suggested her fans listen to their body as she wrote,<strong> “Honestly you have to listen to your body and know when to sit down or it will definitely sit you down…in the ER. Mine sat my ass down in the proper fluids and nutrients put back into my body all night/morning & will take the next few off days to continue to recover.”</strong></span></p><p><span>The rapper then promises her fans to be back better than ever and concludes her post by saying,<strong> “ I promise I will be back to CT rescheduled and better than ever & all tickets will be honored for yesterday’s show!!! Shoutout to my lovelies @arilennox & @sevyn for holdin it downnnn! As well as Heather Lowery and the entire @femmeitforward team for their extreme understanding & support. Shout to @babyjune4 for holding it down for mommy.”</strong></span></p><p><span>Teyana Taylor had previously stopped her show after she saw a fan not feeling well. She asked the security to help the fan to get some air on stage and said, <strong>“I’m about to retire. You ain’t gonna sue me, baby…want to make sure you’re a good baby.”</strong> After the fan got some help from the security team, she made her fan say rose peta and returned her to the crowd saying, <strong>“Okay, baby. You good.”</strong></span></p><p><span>Back in August, the singer had shared that she went under emergency surgery in Miami after finding lumps in her breasts, as per People magazine.</span></p><p><span>The singer had scheduled a tour on 30 November in Atlanta, GA, US, which has been canceled.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Net Worth Of Teyana Taylor</span></strong></h2><p><span>The 30-year-old American singer has an estimated net worth of $5 million as she sets a successful career of singing, songwriting, rapping, and acting. She was also named Maxim’s sexiest Woman Alive in 2021 and said, <strong>“I’ve followed Maxim for a long time and I’ve always felt like I should be on the cover. So to actually get the call saying they want me on the cover really meant a lot.”</strong></span></p><p><span>The rapper released her debut studio album ‘VII’ in 2014, which reached #1 on the US R&B and US R&B/Hip-Hop charts. Her debut album was followed by her albums ‘K.T.S.E’ and ‘The Album.’ She has also acted in movies like Stomp the Yard: Homecoming, Madea’s Big Happy Family, and Coming 2 America. She has also launched a workout apparel line titled Fade2Fit and created the Fade 2 Fit Program.</span></p><p><span>Though she has a successful career as a singer-songwriter and rapper, she announced her retirement from music, saying she <strong>“I am going to feel underappreciated if I’m putting in 110 percent and my label is giving me…what, 10 percent of that. I put in a lot of work I felt like the label wasn’t really hearing me and seeing me. I feel underappreciated. It’s not that I retired permanently, it’s more like, I don’t want to move another inch for a company.”</strong></span></p><p><span>Her husband has also spoken about her decision to retire from music, saying, <strong>“It’s tough to watch because I’m there. I see the work she puts in. I see the frustrations that happen with everyone not agreeing on an idea. I see the frustrations that happen when the rollout doesn’t go as planned because somebody drops the ball.”</strong></span></p><h2><span><strong>Teyana Taylor House</strong></span></h2><p><span>Teyana Taylor lives in an ATL mansion that has an eye-popping interior décor designed by Atlanta-based artist Pashlima. The house has a 2-D designed living room and has an eclectic array of artwork, including painted skateboards, Roman-inspired busts, and multiple statues.</span></p><p><span>She had talked about her mansion on her reality show We Got love saying, “I’m an aesthetic person, we want everything to look a certain way. I’ve always loved movies and also cartoons, so this is something that really represents me. There’s definitely still a lot more work to be done, but it feels good to finally be able to have just one place to call home.”</span></p><p><span>Teyana Taylor was married to her boyfriend, Iman Shumpert, in 2016. They had a secret marriage in the bathroom after getting engaged in 2015. The singer had shared,<strong> “We got married in the bathroom where our baby was born, so we just wanted it for good luck before we did the big wedding. It wasn’t like inside the bathroom. We had like little cute double doors. It still looked cute.”</strong> The singer also shared a photo of herself and her hubby wearing matching leather jackets that read ‘I do’ and ‘I do too.’&nbsp; With their daughter Junie whose jacket said, ‘Oh! Me too..” and wrote a sweet and cool caption that said, <strong>“Love is an emblem of eternity: it confounds all notion of time, it faces all memory of a beginning and all fear on end.”</strong></span></p><p><span>The couple shares two beautiful daughters together. They are Rue Rose Shumpert and Junie Shumpert. They welcomed their daughter Rue Rose Shumpert in September 2020 and their eldest Junie in 2015. They both were born in the family’s bathroom.
