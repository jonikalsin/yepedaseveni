Andriy Lunin, who joined Real Madrid from Zorya Lugansk the same summer Courtois did, understands this well.</p><p>Since then, Lunin has had multiple loan periods, but he only played twice for Real Valladolid and seven times for Leganés.</p><p>He appeared in at least 20 games for Real Oviedo in Spain’s second division in the second half of 2019/20.</p><p>The Ukrainian has been Real Madrid’s number two since the summer of 2020, and he has only appeared on the pitch once, in a 2-1 Copa del Rey defeat to third-tier Alcoyano on January 20th of this year. Lunin hasn’t had a chance in 298 days, despite Carlo Ancelotti clearly liking him.</p><p>It’s extremely difficult to bench a top-tier goalkeeper like Courtois, especially now that there are no easy games in LaLiga Santander. This means that Lunin may need to try again for a loan if he is to demonstrate his abilities. If the 22-year-old does leave in January, MARCA has identified three clubs that have expressed an interest.</p><h2>Number 3: Granada</h2><p>Granada, who has had a difficult start to the season and has a question mark at the goalkeeper after the summer departure of Rui Silva, is one of the clubs that could be interested in acquiring Lunin on loan.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Lunin.jpg><p>Although Luis Maximiano was brought in for €4.5 million, he has yet to fully convince, which could give Lunin a chance to win the job.</p><h2>Number 2: Espanyol</h2><p>Another Spanish club, Espanyol, has been linked with a January move for Lunin. Diego López is their current starter and doing well, but he’s 40 and Lunin might play.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/ll-3.jpg><h2>Number 1: Lille</h2><p>Lille is another club said to be interested in Lunin. The French champions lost title-winning goalkeeper Mike Maignan in the summer and replaced him with Atlético Madrid loanee Ivo Grbic. Lille reportedly wants to sign a Real Madrid backup goalkeeper.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Lunin-r.jpg><p>If Lunin does go on loan this January, he and Real Madrid must make the right decision. He’s already had two loan spells where he was almost as much of a backup as he is now. Perhaps the best option is to wait and see if a club’s starter is lost due to a transfer or injury. Because Lunin needs to play, and he needs to play soon.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGirqKhdaHqkuNSbqmasmJbBbq%2FOrqOdZZiaubF5y66loqZdnLK1ec6fnWasmJp6o7HNnJ9mmaRiv6aty2akmpyinrFuwc%2BdmK2dlGK8pMDOm5yrZWJlf3N7</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
