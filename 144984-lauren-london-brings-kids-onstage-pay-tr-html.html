One of the kids recalled a recent encounter with Hussle.</p><p class=Fg>The Staples Center in Hussle’s hometown of Los Angeles was filled with <a class="Xd a" href=#>loved ones</a> paying their last respects to the rapper and among them were <a class="Xd a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://people.com/music/nipsey-hussle-funeral-lauren-london-son-takes-mic-nephew-recalls-seeing-him-in-dream/>his children</a>, both biological and otherwise.</p><p><h3 class=Kg>A VISIT FROM HUSSLE</h3></p><p class=Fg>London, 34, came up on stage with her and Hussle’s two-year-old son Kross, her son from a previous relationship, Cameron Carter, the rapper’s daughter with an ex, Emani, and his nephew, Khalil Kimble.</p><p class=Fg>Taking the mic first, Cameron (who London shares with rapper Lil Wayne), <a class="Xd a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e67mYOamgmg">described</a> a dream he had about Hussle (birth name Ermias Asghedom) just two days after the “Victory Lap” rapper was shot to death.</p><p class=Fg>“On the night of April 2nd, I had a dream. I was in paradise, and I was playing in the ocean water when Ermias popped up right behind me,” the little boy <a class="Xd a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e67mYOamgmg">narrated</a>. “He said ‘What’s up Killa!’ cos that’s my nickname to him.”</p><p><h3 class=Kg>PRESERVING HIS LEGACY</h3></p><p class=Fg>"I turned around and I yelled his name and I gave him a hug. Shortly, he was gone but it was still cool I guess. I told my mom about the dream and after I told her, I was thinking about it. And I realized that Ermias told me what heaven was like. He told me it was paradise.”</p><p class=Fg>Cameron then asked the thousands of <a class="Xd a" href=#>fans and well-wishers</a> in the arena to yell “Respect” as Hussle used to do every morning when he was alive.</p><p><h3 class=Kg>NERVOUS KIDS & A MOTHER'S REGRET</h3></p><p class=Fg>Hussle’s daughter, Emani, was too nervous to say anything and so was his nephew Khalil. Two-year-old Kross, oblivious of the day’s significance, took the mic but only uttered some incoherent baby talk while smiling. It was sweet and heartbreaking to watch at the same time.</p><p class=Fg>London, who urged the crowd to “give the kids some love” because they’re a little nervous, also confessed during an <a class="Xd a" href=#>emotional tribute</a> that her pain is for her “two-year-old that probably won’t remember how much his dad loved him.”</p><p><h3 class=Kg>A LOVER'S PAIN</h3></p><p class=Fg>Also paying tribute to the man she dated for nearly six years, the actress described him as “a gentle father, a patient leader, [and] a divine light.”</p><p class=Fg>“His soul was majestic. He was the strongest man that I ever knew,” London <a class="Xd a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzUXonhJo3Y&t=13s">added</a>, after confessing that she had “never felt this type of pain before.”</p><p><h3 class=Kg>FIGHTING FOR JUSTICE</h3></p><p class=Fg>Hussle <a class="Xd a" href=#>died</a> 35 minutes after getting shot multiple times outside his south LA clothing store “The Marathon” on Sunday, March 31. He was 33.</p><p class=Fg>29-year-old Eric Holder has been arrested as a suspect in the shooting and, according to the LAPD, has been <a class="Xd a" href=#>charged</a> with one count of murder, two counts of attempted murder and one count of possession of a firearm by a felon.</p><p class=Fg>Holder, an aspiring rapper, could face a maximum sentence of life in state prison if convicted.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlazAb63MqKSapZFjsLC5jmprbXFoaXqtrdSrnKdlnKS7pbvNZpmroZ6cwG63yJ2qZqeeqMGis8Rmp5qxXam%2Fb7TTpqM%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
