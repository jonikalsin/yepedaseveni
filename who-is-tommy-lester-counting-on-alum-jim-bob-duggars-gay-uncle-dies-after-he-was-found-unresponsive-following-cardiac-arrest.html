We all have been well aware of his thoughts and practices. Hence, keeping his gay uncle a secret might not sound too strange to anyone. On Sunday, the patriarch of the Duggar family lost his gay uncle Tommy Lester.</p><p>As soon as Tommy's death was confirmed, police called the 'Counting On' alum to disclose the tragic news. It was strange knowing that Jim was next to the kin of his dead uncle as the Duggar family disassociates themselves from having any relationship with gay families. On Tommy's death, Amy Duggar revealed how was the relationship between the Duggar family and Jim Bob's uncle Tommy Lester.</p><p><b>Also Read</b>: <a href=#>What is Charlie Cox's net worth?

Mary had three siblings, Connie Beard, Billy Lester, and Tommy Lester. Being a gay person in the family, Tommy was married to Lawrence. Not much is known about Tommy. According to <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Without A Crystal Ball</a>'s report, the Duggars did not have an amicable relationship with Tommy. Amy Duggar King revealed to the outlet that the Duggar family has been estranged from their gay uncle for decades. Tommy's sister Mary died on June 9, 2019, after drowning in a swimming pool.&nbsp;</p><p>View this post on Instagram</p><p><a href=# rel=noopener>Shared post</a> on Time</p><p>SALEM — Alternative Therapies Group, the only recreational marijuana <a href=#>embed Instagram code</a> CEO Chris Edwards confirmed Wednesday that ATG has "signed.</p><p><b>Also Read</b>: <a href=#>How did Alaqua Cox lose her leg?

Tommy's death was natural. He was pronounced dead on Sunday after having a cardiac arrest. Tommy had fallen down multiple times that night. However, he refused to get any medical help after Lawrence requested him to get to the hospital. Tommy fell down for one last time after waking up from sleep. He yelled for help. But before his husband could reach out for help, he found him unresponsive on the floor. Lawrence immediately took Tommy to the hospital where he was pronounced dead.&nbsp;</p><p><b>Also Read</b>: <a href=#>Who is Alaqua Cox's boyfriend?

Despite rushing to the hospital immediately, Tommy could not survive. The news of his death was first notified to Jim Bob by the police. Jim Bob was next of kin to Tommy. Well, this was strange as the Duggar family's patriarch Jim Bob is known for being homophobic. Therefore, him being the next of kin to Tommy was unusual. According to the reports, the Duggars went to the church on Sunday, an hour after the news of the death. Amy further revealed that Duggars had been estranged from Tommy for decades.</p><p><span><b>More from <i>MEAWW</i></b></span></p><p><a href=#>'Sounds fire': Fans praise Alabama Barker, compare her with rapper Latto as she drops snippet of her unreleased song</a></p><p><a href=#>Golden Globes 2024: Internet amused as Kieran Culkin roasts 'The Last of Us', says 'suck it' to Pedro Pascal after his win</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmillZbEuHrCqKRor5ikeqq%2FjK2mpqWpYrmmv9OeqWabn6q7tbXNoGSopl2Wuba5jKOgpmWSpK9usNSgnpqqo2K0osWMrqWcpJVisaqx0maYn6yVp3qpsYywmKxllqTCr7CMrqWrnaOlvK%2B%2FyK%2BcZp6fobmww8innmabkaexqq3CZpirqpWowQ%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
