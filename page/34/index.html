The Protomen Lyrics
Jump to: Overall Meaning ↴&nbsp;&nbsp;Line by Line Meaning ↴I can feel it coming in the air tonight, oh Lord And I've been waiting for this moment for all my life, Oh Lord Can you feel it coming in the air tonight, oh Lord, oh Lord Well, if you told me you were drowning I would not lend a hand I've seen your face before my friend But I don't know if you know who I am Well, I was there and I saw what you did I saw it with my own two eyes So you can wipe off that grin, I know where you've been It's all been a pack of lies And I can feel it coming in the air tonight, oh Lord Well, I've been waiting for this moment for all my life, oh Lord I can feel it coming in the air tonight, oh Lord, oh Lord And I've been waiting for this moment for all my life, oh Lord, oh Lord Well I remember, I remember don't worry How could I ever forget, It's the first time, the last time we ever met But I know the reason why you keep your silence up, No you don't fool me The hurt doesn't show But the pain still grows It's no stranger to you and me And I can feel it coming in the air tonight, oh Lord Well, I've been waiting for this moment for all my life, oh Lord I can feel it in the air tonight, oh Lord, oh Lord But I've been waiting for this moment for all my life, oh Lord I can feel it coming in the air tonight, oh Lord But I've been waiting for this moment for all my life, oh Lord I can feel it in the air tonight, oh Lord, oh Lord, oh Lord But I've been waiting for this moment for all my life, oh Lord, oh Lord. <a href=../../in-the-air-tonight.html>Read More...</a></section></article><article class=list-item itemscope itemtype=http://schema.org/Blog><h2 class=headline itemprop=headline><a href=../../jim-toth-net-worth.html>Jim Toth Net Worth, Wife, Children, Parents, Age, Height</a></h2><div class=meta><span class=key>published on</span>
