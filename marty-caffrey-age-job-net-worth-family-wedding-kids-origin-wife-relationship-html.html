Becker&nbsp;Inc., a now-defunct banking firm. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-182 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2>Marty Caffrey's Relationship with&nbsp;Danielle Staub</h2><p>As per reports from <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">People</a>, Caffrey and&nbsp;Staub started&nbsp;dating in April 2016 and were vocal about their romantic connection, posting pictures of one another on their social media handles. They even lived together in Staubs's home in New Jersey.</p><p>In May 2017, the entrepreneur proposed to the television personality with a diamond&nbsp;ring in a mansion.

Only 60 guests, including Staub's two daughters, Christine&nbsp;and Jillian, and her co-stars from RHONW, attended the celebration.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-183 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Despite a grand wedding, the marriage didn't last long as the pair faced&nbsp;marital issues within two months of marriage.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>In their third month, the wife&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">filed a&nbsp;restraining order</a> against Caffrey for verbal abuse following a dispute in their home. The husband&nbsp;also did the same the following day. But later, both of them dropped the orders.&nbsp;</p><p>Then on August 14, 2018, Caffrey filed for divorce at&nbsp;a New Jersey court. Amid the divorce proceedings, the separation took a nasty turn when&nbsp;Caffrey put their house&nbsp;on sale online for $2,195,000.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>Staub reportedly tried to get back the&nbsp;house from the court, but she couldn't and had to vacate it.&nbsp;</p><h2>Marty Caffrey Has Three Kids From Previous Marriage</h2><p>Before Staub, Caffrey was <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">married</a>&nbsp;to&nbsp;Gail Marie Sincavage,&nbsp;a&nbsp;New York University graduate.
