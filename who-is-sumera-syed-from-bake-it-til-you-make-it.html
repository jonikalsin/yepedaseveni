The program offers a distinct viewpoint by presenting many individuals on their path to achievement.&nbsp;According to Discovery’s press release concerning the show:</p><p>“Bake It ‘Til You Make It, a new docu-series airing on Food Network on Monday, December 26th at 9 pm ET/PT, takes an inside peek into the peculiar world of competitive baking and the incredibly passionate, over-the-top characters that participate.”</p><p>It goes on:</p><p>“The series, narrated by legendary cake decorator Duff Goldman, follows seven competitive bakers as they feverishly chase their dreams of sweet glory in some of the country’s hardest baking contests.”</p><p>Sumera Syed of Dallas, Texas, is one of the bakers that will feature in the episode. Sumera was raised in England in an Indian-Pakistani family and is a self-taught baker who previously featured on MasterChef UK in 2014. Watch her begin her trip as part of Bake It ‘Til You Make It on December 26 at 9 p.m. ET.</p><h2>Sumera Syed, a Bake It ‘Til You Make It participant, enjoys making pastries with Persian tastes.</h2><p>The future Bake It ‘Til You Make It star described herself as “a little crazy,” enthusiastic, and vibrant. The self-taught baker learned how to bake via the internet and was first more interested in cooking than baking.&nbsp;The Bake It ‘Til You Make It candidate told The Dallas Morning News that in Pakistan, any dessert would have been prepared on the stovetop or deep fried.</p><p>She continued, saying:</p><p>“In Pakistan, we don’t bake.”</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Sumera-Syed-2.jpg alt="Sumera Syed" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>She went on to say that it wasn’t until her mother bought a cookbook with photographs and recipes for western cuisine that she began to wonder why they don’t “have anything like that.”&nbsp;The Bake It ‘Til You Make It cast member resided in England and grew raised in a Muslim family before migrating to Dallas, Texas. She was 18 years old the first time she celebrated Thanksgiving or Christmas. She has a series on her social media called “the 12 days of Christmas Cookies by Sumera the Baker.”</p><h2>Sumera enjoys making sweets with Persian tastes like saffron, pistachio, fennel, and others.</h2><p>The baker spoke about her time on the Food Network program, saying she met a lot of amazing folks that “know their business.” Sumera, on the other hand, said that she just strolled in with her cake.&nbsp;Traveling with her treats, on the other hand, was one of the difficulties she encountered throughout the process. She remembered feeling embarrassed at the airport with her varied desserts and storing her fragile pieces in the plane’s overhead bin.</p><p>She continued, saying:</p><p>“I just hoped nobody started banging it about when they placed it in their rolly case.”</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Sumera-Syed.jpg alt="Sumera Syed" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Bake It ‘Til You Make It is a non-eliminating program, so every cast member will be with you the whole time.
