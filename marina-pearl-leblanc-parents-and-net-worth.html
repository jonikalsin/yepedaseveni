I was on the verge of going into shock.</p><h2><span id=What_is_the_number_of_siblings_that_Marina_Pearl_LeBlanc_has>What is the number of siblings that Marina Pearl LeBlanc has?</span></h2><p>Although Marina has two half-siblings from her mother’s previous relationships, she does not have any biological siblings.
