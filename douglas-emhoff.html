He also gained the name after his spouse entered the limelight with U.S. senator <a href=#><strong>Kamala Harris</strong></a>. She is also going to run for the presidency in the 2020 election as per the tabloid. Exactly similar to <a href=#><strong>Lauren London</strong></a> who also rose to prominence by her famous husband <a href=#><strong>Lil Wayne</strong></a>.</p><p>It is important to consider that the partner to the potential first female president of Black and South Asian-American could eventually become the United States of America's first "first man."</p><p>Douglas Emhoff was born in 1964, however, his precise date of birth and birthplace is not given. Detailed data about his parents and siblings is also not available.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2019/8/4/Capture%20(3)-1564908543477.jpg><p>In 1982, he graduated from California State University, Northridge with a Bachelor of Arts degree in Communications and Media Studies. Later, at the University of Southern California, Gould School of Law, he decided to follow a law course and received his Juris Doctorate in 1990. Another celebrity, <a href=#><strong>Amber Brkich</strong></a> also holds a Bachelor of Arts degree in public relations.</p><p>Emhoff joined Pillsbury Winthrop Shaw Pittman LLP in the Greater Los Angeles Area in 1990 after finishing his studies. He moved in the same region to Bingham McCutchen LLP, but went back to Pillsbury Winthrop Shaw Pittman LLP and continued to work for the next three years in that role.</p><p>Based on the speculation that he could possibly become the US's first 'First Man,' if his spouse, Senator Kamala Harris, runs for the 2020 presidency.</p><h2>Douglas Emhoff Personal Life: Wife & Children</h2><p>While Douglas Emhoff is best acknowledged as Kamala Harris ' husband, people are unware by the fact that he was previously married once to <strong>Emhoff Kerstin</strong>. Yet they were unable to sustain their married life for a long time and got divorced.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2019/8/4/Capture%20(1)-1564908355117.jpg><p>His ex-wife Kerstin is the co-founder, chairman and executive producer of the PrettyBird production company that creates films. The production house has already created some of the flims such as <i>The Tillman Story</i>, <i>The Monster</i>, and <i>The Trust</i>. He also has a son named <strong>Cole Emhoff</strong> from his first marriage and a daughter named <strong>Ella Emhoff</strong>.</p><p>Douglas encountered Kamala for the first time on a blind date set by one of their close colleagues. The two quickly struck it off, and about a year later he offered her a diamond and platinum ring in her apartment to marry him. The pair disclosed they were engaged on April 7, 2014.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2019/8/4/Capture%20(2)-1564908454688.jpg><p>They had planned to get married soon because Harris didn't like long commitments. So, at the Santa Barbara County Courthouse in Santa Barbara, California, the couple tied the knot on August 22, 2014. The ceremony was a private affair officiated by her sister <strong>Maya Harris</strong>, an attorney and MSNBC political&nbsp;analysis. Till now, the couple do not share any children together.&nbsp;</p><h2>Douglas Emhoff's Net Worth</h2><p>Both Emhoff and his wife Harris are successful in their respective professions and are engaged in numerous charitable causes as well. They had a combined revenue of almost <strong>$1.17 million</strong>, which cost them about <strong>$450,000</strong> in state and federal income taxes, according to their 2015 tax filings.</p><p>Similarly, the duo gave <strong>$32,947 </strong>to charity, including a gift of <strong>$10,000</strong> to UNICEF. In the same way, they donated cash to several academic institutions, including <strong>$1,250</strong> to Southern California University, its alma mater, <strong>$1,000</strong> to the domestic non-profit College Track and <strong>$100</strong> to CASA of Los Angeles.</p><p>Douglas had huge inventory holdings in firms such as Citibank, Wells Fargo, and Monsanto as well. But as his wife started her Senate campaign in 2015, he sold off all his stocks. There is no precise net worth figure as for now.</p><p><strong>Click on </strong><a href=#><strong>marriedceleb</strong></a><strong> for more detail.</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmilkae%2FqrHDnJylnZJjsLC5jp2mrp%2BclsBuscyhpp%2Be</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
