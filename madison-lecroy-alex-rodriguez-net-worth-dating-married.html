I go to other people and I’m like. She’s just my person. And I’m telling myself to quit fighting it. And it’s just not cut-and-dried sometimes. I mean, I think that you love someone like this maybe only once in your life. So, it would be silly to walk away from it. Until all options are exhausted, Madison will be my person."</strong></span></p><p><span>Madison started dating Jay Cutler in 2021.&nbsp;At the time, Jay was recently divorced from his ex-wife Kristin Cavallari.
