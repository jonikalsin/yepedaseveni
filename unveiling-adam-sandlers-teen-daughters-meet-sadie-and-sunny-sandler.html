(2023)</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Sadie and Sunny were both raised in the Jewish faith, helped by their mom's conversion to Judaism in 2000 before she married Adam Sandler.</span></p><h2><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Interests, Activities, and Hobbies</span></h2><h4><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Sadie</span></h4><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Proving to be a quintet of an entertainer herself, Sadie-Mae has been involved in the theater and performing arts world while pursuing her education.&nbsp; You can often spot her with her family at special events and premiers, showing support for her father.</span></p><h4><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Sunny</span></h4><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Sunny Sandler has made a name for herself as an actress and a vocalist. In June 2019, during one of Adam Sandler's comedy shows, she sang a number from "The Greatest Showman" on stage to receive an ovation standing performance. Sunny has often accompanied him at public events, and her love for singing was visible, which meant soon people heard that she, too, could sing well.</span></p><h2><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Family Life and Values</span></h2><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Despite their fame, the Sandler family is private and extremely tight-knit. With the support of their supportive parents, both Sadie and her sister Sunny have been able to try out being in showbiz.
