Her parents divorced when she was eight years old, and she later claimed that her mother, who died in a car accident in 1985, often harassed her. Her early years were generally traumatic.</p><p>O’Connor was arrested for shoplifting, expelled from Catholic school, and brought to a reformatory after being detained. She sang a cover of Barbra Streisand’s “Evergreen” at a wedding when she was 15 years old, and Paul Byrne, the drummer for the Irish band In Tua Nua (better known as U2’s proteges), overheard her.</p><p>After co-writing the first In Tua Nua hit, “Take My Hand,” O’Connor quit boarding school to focus on a career in music and began performing in nearby coffee shops. In the future, she sent singing telegrams for a living while enrolled in voice and piano lessons at the Dublin College of Music.</p><h2>Is Sinéad O’Connor currently married?
