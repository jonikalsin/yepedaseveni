According to authoritative sources, LA Capone’s wealth was as high as $200,000, earned through his very short career as a rapper.</p><h3>LA Capone Net Worth $200,000</h3><p>Raised by a single mother, Dedra Morris, LA Capone soon found himself on the streets of Chicago’s West Side. He joined the Black Disciples gang, but soon became friendly with rappers <a href=#>Lil Durk</a>, and <a href=#>Chief Keef</a>. Gradually LA Capone’s popularity within the game rose, and he started working with RondoNumbaNine and appeared in several of the rapper’s videos. After a while, LA Capone started recording his own music, but before he could release any material, he was killed in a shooting that happened on the 26th September 2013, just a few days after his 17th birthday. He was leaving a recording studio, and while approaching his car in a nearby street, an attacker approached him and fired four bullets. He was transferred to hospital, but he passed away on the operating table, as he was losing blood at a rapid rate, and doctors were unable to save him.</p><p>Subsequently a mixtape entitled “King LA” was released posthumously, and featured such songs as “Play for Keeps”, and “Round Here”, which were already known to the public, and new material “So Loud”, and “The Gat”, which became hits following Capone’s death.</p><p>Three persons were arrested for LA Capone’s death in 2014, Sakhee Hardy-Johnson, who is 17 years old, Michael Mays, who has 21, and Meiko Buchanan, oldest of the three at 22 years. They all confessed to the crime, and Hardy-Johnson has been sentenced to 45 years in prison, whilst for the other there is no available information in the media.</p><p>Many of LA Capone’s fans have paid respect to the deceased artist, and contributed to his funeral, and are all keeping alive the memory of the young rapper.</p>﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿<table readability=3><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>$200,000</td></tr><tr><td>Date Of Birth</td><td>September 18, 1996</td></tr><tr readability=6><td>Died</td><td>September 26, 2013, Chicago, Illinois, United States</td></tr><tr><td>Place Of Birth</td><td>Chicago, Illinois USA</td></tr><tr><td>Profession</td><td>Rapper</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>American</td></tr><tr><td>Parents</td><td>Dedra Morris</td></tr><tr><td>Albums</td><td>Separate My Self</td></tr></table><br><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlanEsL7Toaeoq6RjvLOzjqWYZpuRpbyvsYynnK1lp6S%2FtbSO</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
