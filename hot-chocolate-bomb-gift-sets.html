How, you might ask? Well, the sets I’m giving are of deliciously flavored <a href=#>hot cocoa bombs</a>. That’s how.</p><p>Related Stories</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Outlander.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Outlander.jpg><p>These sets either come as individually wrapped assortments of flavors ranging from cookies and cream to peppermint, or as gift boxes (a few come with a single purchase). This kind of division makes it so easy for gifting. For example, with <a href=# rel=nofollow>Chocolate Works’ pumpkin spice set</a>, six cocoa bombs come individually wrapped. Because of this savvy construction, I’m able to give these treats to a half-dozen of my friends, neighbors, and colleagues. With just one purchase, I crossed six people off my nice list. Maybe somebody should tell Santa about this strategy.</p><p>There are a bunch of hot cocoa bomb boxes available at QVC, where you can buy ones that have up to 12 assorted flavors in one set. Think of them like chocolate boxes for Valentine’s Day, only bigger and better. The seasonal goodies are the feel-good type of gift that really can’t go wrong. They look good, taste good, and are so fun to watch explode into an ooey, gooey treat.</p><p>Below, check out five options that will make your holiday shopping so much easier (and sweeter!)</p><p>Our mission at STYLECASTER is to bring style to the people, and we only feature products we think you’ll love as much as we do.
