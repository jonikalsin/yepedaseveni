That’s right, </i><a href=#>The Great British Baking Show: Holidays</a>&nbsp;is back for a fourth season, and it’s now available to stream on Netflix. Contestants who made it to various stages of the competition in the past return to the tent to get merry and make some holiday magic in the famous kitchen. We’re here to tell you if this season lives up to its predecessors.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Opening Shot:</strong> Our crew of judges fly through the air on Santa’s sleigh.</p><p><strong>The Gist:</strong> We’re back, folks, and it’s Christmas in May! Bakers from past seasons of&nbsp;<a href=#>The Great British Baking Show</a>&nbsp;including hilarious uni student Jamie from Season 10 (who made it to Week 2), James, who made it halfway through Season 8, Ruby, who made it to the final of Season 9, and Rosie, who made it to week 9 of Season 10. For the first round, the group must make 12 festive miniature panettones, with some opting to go the more traditional route, while others embrace their more playful, tropical side. Beloved judges Paul Hollywood and Prue Leith weigh in on each of the Italian treats, while hosts Matt Lucas and Tom Allen — <a href=#>standing in for Noel Fielding</a>, who is on paternity leave — crack jokes and make light of the occasional mishap.</p><p>For the second round, they’re given an hour and fifteen minutes to make Christmas pudding (in the microwave!). Each of the contestants gives their all, even when the end result isn’t necessarily ideal, and for the Showstopper Challenge, each baker must create a spectacular illusion cake that represents their ultimate Christmas Day feast. James creates a ham centerpiece, Rosie a turkey, Jamie a bucket of fried turkey, and Ruby the spaghetti breakfast from&nbsp;Elf. Will these creations taste as good as they look? Only Paul and Prue can decide that, and who wins it all in this installment of&nbsp;The Great British Baking Show: Holidays.&nbsp;</p><figure id=attachment_1045458 class="wp-caption alignnone aligncenter"><span class=credit>Photo: Netflix</span></figure><p><strong>What Shows Will It Remind You Of?</strong>&nbsp;The Great British Baking Show: Holidays&nbsp;might remind you a little of&nbsp;<a href=#>Sugar Rush Christmas</a>,&nbsp;<a href=#>Nailed It!: Holiday</a>,&nbsp;<a href=#>Holiday Baking Championship</a>, and&nbsp;Christmas Cookie Challenge.</p><p><strong>Our Take:&nbsp;</strong>One of the most wonderful things about&nbsp;The Great British Baking Show&nbsp;is that you know you’re going to be satisfied every time you watch. There’s a very specific itch it scratches, a mixture of a warm hug and a quirky conversation with an old friend. This installment of&nbsp;The Great British Baking Show: Holidays&nbsp;once again offers the same comfort as its predecessors, sticking to the tried-and-true formula that has won over millions of viewers for years and allowing us to feast with our eyes on the festive confectionary delights on display throughout the episode. Tom Allen does a fabulous, funny job standing in for Noel Fielding, though his presence is certainly missed. It’s a lovely group they’ve chosen, too, from Jamie’s endearing sense of humor about himself and Ruby’s out-of-the-box thinking on the final challenge to Rosie’s perfectionism and James’s Brussels sprout trick. Never change, The Great British Baking Show. We don’t know what we’d do if you did.</p><p><strong>Sex and Skin:</strong> None.</p><p><strong>Parting Shot: </strong>The bakers applaud as a moving rendition of “Silent Night” concludes and they celebrate their winner.</p><p><strong>Sleeper Star:&nbsp;</strong>Jamie is undeniably the most delightful part of this episode of The Great British Baking Show: Holidays, self-aware about his lack of culinary prowess but willing to give it his all and try his best anyway. He’s got a great sense of humor about himself and his baking, and is able to banter with the hosts and judges with ease and a twinkle in his eye even as his creme anglaise splits and his pudding overcooks. Every competition show needs a goofball, and Jamie more than fits the bill.</p><p><strong>Most Pilot-y Line:</strong> No pilot-y lines here. Just lots of dessert-based, corny British humor.</p><p><strong>Our Call:</strong> STREAM IT.&nbsp;The Great British Baking Show: Holidays&nbsp;remains a sweet treat of a TV show, effortlessly reminding us why we return to the tent time and time again.</p><p>Jade Budowski is a freelance writer with a knack for ruining punchlines, hogging the mic at karaoke, and thirst-tweeting.
