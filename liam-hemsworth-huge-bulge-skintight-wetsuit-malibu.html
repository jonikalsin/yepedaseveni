In the Australian hunk’s latest ocean excursion, he rocked a black bodysuit that showed off his incredible physique — and massive bulge. We definitely have a much deeper understanding of his girlfriend <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Miley Cyrus</strong></a>‘ hit song “Malibu” now having seen&nbsp;what the actor looks like when he hangs out on a California beach. We’d write a song about him, too! Check out the sexy photo below!</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>Since “Malibu” will now be playing in our heads for the rest of the day, we can’t help but wonder what Miley would think of her boyfriend’s sexy wetsuit. The 25-year-old singer has definitely never been shy about admiring her man’s good looks before! She even gave her beau a shoutout on Instagram earlier this month when she posted a pic of him from a recent photo shoot. ““Damn. My man looking hunky as f*ck!” she captioned the image. TBH, does Liam ever&nbsp;not&nbsp;look “hunky as f*ck” though? Click here to see pictures of the couple!</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>While Liam has been looking mighty fine on the west coast, he’s completely off-limits. His relationship with Miley has been getting more and more serious lately. The heartthrob gifted his partner a rainbow necklace that said his nickname, “LiLi” on it for her 25th birthday on Nov. 23. There were even rumors going around that the couple were expecting their first child after the “We Can’t Stop” singer posted an image around Thanksgiving of what seemed to show a “bump” — but Miley called the rumors out for being absolutely false (and also pretty rude). She set the record straight saying that she wasn’t pregnant, just enjoying a ton of tofurkey. Fair enough, Miley!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/liam-hemsworth-bulge-backgrid-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-5><strong>HollywoodLifers</strong>, what do you think about Liam’s sexy surfing session?
